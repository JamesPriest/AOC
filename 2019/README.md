# 2019

This is the folder containing all solutions for the 2019 advent calender of code. 

Observations so far

 - Days 1 to 4 were pretty straightforward. Some solutions on the [subreddit](www.reddit.com/adventofcode) achieved a better speed for Day 4 but I'm happy with my solution as it makes clear why a codeword would fail/succeed in the code rather than look for an optimisation.
